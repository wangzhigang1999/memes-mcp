## Quick Start Guide
### Step 1: Choose a Suitable Client
To enjoy all the features of MCP, please start by downloading a compatible client. We recommend [Cherry Studio](https://github.com/CherryHQ/cherry-studio), which is a powerful and user-friendly tool.
### Step 2: Configure the MCP Server
After installing and launching Cherry Studio or your chosen client, simply follow the prompts within the software to add the MCP server address to your client and get started.
**Note:** Ensure you enter the correct server URL `https://mcp.bupt.site` to guarantee a successful connection.
**Have fun! 😄🌟**
